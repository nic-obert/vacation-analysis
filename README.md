# Vacation Analysis

This is a school project that consists of analyzing the vacation habits of young people.  

The data was collected through a Google Forms survey and the raw data (stripped of personal email addresses) is available in the [data.csv](data.csv) file.  
The survey results are also available in a Google Forms-like format in the [Google Forms Survey Results.html](Google%20Forms%20Survey%20Results.html) file.  
The survey questions are available in a Google Forms-like format in the [Google Forms Survey Questions.html](Google%20Forms%20Survey%20Questions.html) file.

The analysis was conducted using Python and the Pandas library inside a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook with the code is available in the [analyze.ipynb](analyze.ipynb) file.

Unfortunately, the graphic part of project was meant to be done in Italian, so the following charts are in Italian. I translated the chart titles so that you can get the gist of what they are about.  
These charts are in no particular order.
